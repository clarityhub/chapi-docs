Once you have signed up and created an organization, you are ready to create your first **Access Key**!

Access Keys allow you to programatically use our API instead of just through the web application.

## How to create an Access Key

To create an access key:

1. [Login](https://app.clarityhub.io/) to Clarity Hub.
2. [Create an Access Key](https://app.clarityhub.io/access-keys/create) for your organization.
3. Save the Access Key ID and Access Key Secret some where save so you can use them in your applications.

We will only show the Access Key Secret once. If you lose it, feel free to generate a new Access Key.

We can't wait to see what you build using our APIs!
